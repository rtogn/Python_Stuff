Demo code for work. Needed a way to quickly create CSV demographics files for patients to cover a short 
term issue with a system. None of this is relavant anymore but it takes patient data from a master CSV and parses it out
into multiple single patient demographics CSV files. 

All info is just random junk data. No real PI included.
