Tool made for work that picks a set of PDF report files specified in a csv list and moves them along with
their matching csv data file to a special set of folders.

The purpose is to separate tests that were rejected by QA from those that were listed as good. At the time
this communication was done via email with just a list of test #s in the body. The user has to take that list and
put it in a csv file to make this work. 

Includes a basic GUI intented for expansion with other tools as needed.

Essentially this has no use to anyone not directly involved in this exact circumstance.
