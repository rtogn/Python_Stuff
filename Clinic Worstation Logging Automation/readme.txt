Automation program made for a clinic workstation that needed to work with and print various patient logs and requisitions. Alows user to enter a patient
with billing and test information, print from a automatically selected set of requisitions (varions labs, billing methods etc). The system will log the patient in a dated
excel file and print the number of labels needed for tubes and paperwork. Lists of physicians and tests can be updated in the CSV data folders located in /Test_Lists.

For context this clinic did not have a LIMS or HMS so everything was done by hand. 

I have anonymized all lab and clinic references and removed any logos/paperwork which likely has broken some functionality.
